        <div class="title">Cities generate a lot of CO<sub>2</sub></div>
        While cities only occupy 2% of the earth's surface, cities and the cumulative processes of urbanization are estimated to contribute approximately 30-40% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. Anthropogenic (human-caused) GHG emissions, particularly CO<sub>2</sub>, are the primary driver of global climate change. The background co2 concentration has gone from 391 ppm in 2011, it is now 401 ppm beginning in 2016.

        <div class="title">At the Urban Scale</div>
        The <a href="">urban metabolism</a> describes cities as systems of inputs - food, water, fuel, and power - and outputs - solid waste, degraded water, and manufactured goods. Therefore a city's emissions impact are influenced by its form and function.

        <div class="title">At the Local Scale</div>
        The sources of CO<sub>2</sub> in cities can be attributed to two main processes: the combustion of fossil fuels and biological sources.

          <div class="title">Transporation Emissions</div>
          As vehicles burn fuel to power their engines, they emit CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. Vehicle based CO<sub>2</sub> emissions account for about 30% of the total emissions made by people. Each gallon (4 litres) burned amounts to about 20 lbs (~9 kg) of CO<sub>2</sub>.

      <section class="step">
          <div class="title">HVAC Emissions</div>
          Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) emissions come from natural gas that is burned when heating your home in the winter, cooking at your stove, or running air condition and ventilation in the summer.

        <section class="step">
            <div class="title">Biogenic Emissions</div>
            Respiration from plants, soils, animals, and people also account for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. However, plants do uptake CO2 in the process of photosynthesis. In some well vegetated cities, such as Vancouver, BC, vegetation in the summertime can sometimes offset the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from human respiration.

            <div class="title">Cities as solutions</div>
            While cities are major GHG producers, cities also are where emission reductions can be greatest. Policies, technological innovations, and urban design interventions are often most effective at the local scale. Currently policy makers and planners rely on coarse resolution GHG inventories based on models. These models produce <em>emissions estimates</em> based on data on factors like fuel consumption, population density, and urban form and function. While these models are helpful they are limited by the spatial and temporal availability and quality of the input data. Furthermore, there are very few methods to directly measure and verify these model estimates

            <div class="title">Monitoring our progress</div>
            We at <a href="">Micrometeorology group at UBC</a> are directly <em>measuring</em> CO<sub>2</sub> using sensors. From measurements on tethered balloons to our latest efforts using mobile sensors attached to bikes and cars, our research is aimed to enhance our ability to quanitfy emissions in complex environments.<br>
